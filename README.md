# Little Workday Planner

## Description

A daily work schedule planner that stores text in hourly blocks as a to-do list.

For this project the goal was to create this daily work schedule with jquery and have the timeblocks color coded

to represent the current, past, and future hour blocks in red, grey, and green styling respectively.

I learned how to make the save button on click event listener store user input to local storage with jquery during this project.

## Credits

My UNH coding teacher Nicole Thomas and her teaching assistant Robert Hoffman.

I got extra help from my classmate/colleague Carter Michaud, https://github.com/Cmeesh11

, and my tutor Sheetal Srikumar.

Thank you!!
